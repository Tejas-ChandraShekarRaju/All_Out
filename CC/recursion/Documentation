1.Write down the functional definition of the recursive function (base case,and the other cases)
2.fibonacci sequence with recursion is time consuming but with memoization it is as good as iterative but not! ..!..
3.how many numbers are there between a given threshold
--->n=(logFn)+(1/2log5)/(logÏ•)
4.General formula to find the nth fibonacci number
--->there is you have not learnt it
5.Write the recursive tree to understand and write better code for recursion (learnt from permutations)
